# Waste-Management-Using-various-techniques-of-DeepLearning
Waste management is a critical component of sustainable urban development, environmental protection, and resource conservation. Traditional methods of waste segregation are often labor-intensive, error-prone, and inefficient, highlighting the need for intelligent automated solutions. With recent advancements in deep learning, computer vision–based waste classification systems have emerged as promising tools to improve recycling efficiency and reduce landfill burdens. In this study, we present a benchmarking analysis of three deep learning architectures—YOLOv9, VGG16, and EfficientNet—on a custom dataset containing ten distinct waste categories. The models are evaluated across multiple performance dimensions, including classification accuracy, robustness on validation data, and inference speed. Experimental findings indicate that VGG16 achieved the highest accuracy of 99.47%, demonstrating strong potential for precise classification tasks. EfficientNet followed with 97.48%, offering a favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. YOLOv9 achieved 95.3% accuracy while delivering real-time detection capabilities with an inference speed of ~21.6 ms per image, making it suitable for dynamic deployment scenarios. These results highlight important trade-offs between model complexity, accuracy, and speed, providing actionable insights for the design and deployment of AI-driven waste management systems in resource-constrained urban environments.
